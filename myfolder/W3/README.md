Diving deeper into PYTHON specifically comments, Variables and Data types in PYTHON
COMMENTS in PYTHON: These are simply notes that provides information about what a code should do or does.COMMENTS are usually ignored by the the computer. To write a comment in python the # is used to begin the sentence.
VARIABLES IN PYTHON: Variables are containers used to store data values they hold information  that is used in a code. For example, below I created two variables that hold my name and age and then I print "Hello, my name is Damilola and I am 18 years old"  myName = "Damilola" myAge = "18" print("Hello my name is " + name +" and I am" + age + "years old")
DATA TYPES IN PYTHON: Just the way items are categorized into types in a store for example, fruits, vegetables etc. Data are also categorized into types in programming. these types include numbers(intergers and floats) text( string) booleans(true and falsse value). Below are are examples of these data types. message = " I am learning python" age = 18 average_Time = 3.0. Print out the following to determine each data type Print(type(message)) print(type(age)) print(type(average_Time) print(10<9)
